This plugin adds four options to the Divi desktop menu via the wordpress customizer, including options to increase menu breakpoint and menu item hover line animation.


== Description ==

Please note that this plugin does not work with the new DIVI 4 theme.

The plugin adds four menu options to the divi desktop menu via the wordpress customizer.

Plugin Features: 
* The Divi menu breakpoint can be increased when the Header Format is in the default position. ie)The logo is on the left of the header and the menu is on the right. This allows the mobile menu to be displayed at larger screen widths, which can be used to prevent the desktop menu overlapping the logo.
* Change desktop dropdown menu padding. The top and bottom padding of the dropdown menu can be increased or decreased as well as the left and right padding. The top and bottom padding for each dropdown menu item can also be increased or decreased.
* Add hover line effect animation to desktop main menu and dropdown menu, either above or below menu items. The position of the line can be moved vertically and the thickness and color of the line can be changed.
* Change dropdown menu icon, triangle icon or arrow icon.
